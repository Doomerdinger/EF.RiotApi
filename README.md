EF.RiotApi
==========

A .NET library to make calls to and from the RiotApi simpler


Simple Steps To Use
--------
Add your api key to the app config in the tests and the main library. If you don't have one get it at:

https://developer.riotgames.com/

From there you should be pretty good to go.  Just call into RiotWeb to do what you need to. 


Side Note:
--------
Check out the tests to see how calls are made.
